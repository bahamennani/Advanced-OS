  Explanation

    Buffer Structure:
        The circular buffer structure has fields for buffer storage, in and out indices, a count of items, a mutex, and condition variables.

    Initialization and Cleanup:
        init_buffer initializes buffer indices, mutex, and condition variables.
        destroy_buffer releases resources after the program completes.

    Producer:
        The producer locks the buffer, checks if it's full, and waits if necessary.
        Once there is space, it inserts an item, updates indices, signals the consumer, and unlocks the buffer.

    Consumer:
        The consumer locks the buffer, checks if itâ€™s empty, and waits if needed.
        When an item is available, it consumes it, updates indices, signals the producer, and unlocks the buffer.

    Main Function:
        Starts producer and consumer threads, waits for them to finish, and then cleans up resources.

  This implementation synchronizes producer and consumer activities with a mutex and condition variables, ensuring safe access to the shared buffer.
